# random_shakespeare
Downloads and parses Macbeth as xml, gives random quotes from the play. I wrote this for practice, I realize it's quite useless. I am happy with the test suite though. Feedback is welcome, as always.

## Usage:

random_shakespeare = RandomShakespeare.new

random_shakespeare.next # returns a random line
