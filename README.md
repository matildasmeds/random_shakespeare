# *"They are, my lord, without the palace gate."*

## About

RandomShakespeare gives you absolutely random quotes from Macbeth. 

## Usage

```ruby
require_relative 'lib/random_shakespeare.rb'
random_shakespeare = RandomShakespeare.new
random_shakespeare.next # => 'Hey, it's random!'
```

Note that for the first run, you need internet access to download [Macbeth xml file](https://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/macbeth.xml).

## About

I wrote this for practice, I realize it's rather useless. I am happy with the test suite though. Feedback is welcome, as always.
