<LINE>Dispute it like a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACDUFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall do so;</LINE>
<LINE>But I must also feel it as a man:</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot but remember such things were,</LINE>
<LINE>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,</LINE>
<LINE>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</LINE>
<LINE>They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive</LINE>
<LINE>no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentlewoman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon</LINE>
<LINE>her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,</LINE>
<LINE>write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again</LINE>
<LINE>return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once</LINE>
<LINE>the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of</LINE>
<LINE>watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her</LINE>
<LINE>walking and other actual performances, what, at any</LINE>
<LINE>time, have you heard her say?</LINE>
